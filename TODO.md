# TODO
	1. Parser
	2. Interp
	3. CLI tool


#  Ideas
	 Implementing different number bases in the compiler is clearly stupid, we should try to make the simplest language possible.
	 Easy to learn and understand not really easy to use. We can provide a function in the std to convert different nums.
	 Enum support would be super cool. 
	 
# Lexer
	* StringIterator emit tokens on line per line basis insert semicolon if statement is detected
	* Init Token with right metaData -> right now we don't care about line number and filename but for errorReporting in the future we defenetly should

Tasks:

	* CLI wrapper tool for language 
	    1. zuse neu
		2. zuse start
		3. zuse Filename
		4. zuse installiere
