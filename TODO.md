	5. ByteCode vm (in Rust?)

#  Ideas
	 Implementing different number bases in the compiler is clearly stupid, we should try to make the simplest language possible.
	 Easy to learn and understand not really easy to use. We can provide a function in the std to convert different nums.
	 Enum support would be super cool.
